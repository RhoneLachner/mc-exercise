All users should have git pulled from origin main before adding any code, and communicated which files they planned to work  in beforehand. 
Working within the same HTML file at the same time only works if you both have up-to-date code, and you are working in different coding blocks/sections.

If working within the same JS file, communicate what functionality is being changed so that there is no overlap. Use different JS files and Import/export to be safe.
